Logistic Regression: is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. Despite having “regression” in its name, a logistic regression is actually a widely used binary classifier (i.e., the target vector can only take two values). In a logistic regression, a linear model (e.g., β0 + β1x) is included in a logistic (also called sigmoid) function, (1 / (1 + e^-z)), \n","such that : P(yi = 1 | X) = 1 / (1 + e^-(β0 and β1x))\n","\n","where P(yi = 1 | X) is the probability of the ith observation’s target value, yi, being class 1, X is the training data, β0 and β1 are the parameters to be learned, and e is Euler’s number. The effect of the logistic function is to constrain the value of the function’s output to between 0 and 1 so that it can be interpreted as a probability. If P(yi = 1 | X) is greater than 0.5, class 1 is predicted; otherwise, class 0 is predicted.\n","\n","* 2. Decision Tree: Tree-based learning algorithms are a broad and popular family of related nonparametric, supervised methods for both classification and regression. The basis of tree-based learners is the decision tree wherein a series of decision rules (e.g., “If their gender is male…”) are chained. The result looks vaguely like an upside-down tree, with the first decision rule at the top and subsequent decision rules spreading out below. In a decision tree, every decision rule occurs at a decision node, with the rule creating branches leading to new nodes. A branch without a decision rule at the end is called a leaf.\n","Decision tree learners attempt to find a decision rule that produces the greatest decrease in impurity at a node, by default decision tree classifier uses gini imourity, but using exhaustive search we select the best learner for the model by searching ovar a range of hyperparameters. This model uses *ENTROPY* as its base learner: where entropy is the measures of information contained in a state. I f entropy is high then we are very uncertain about the randomly picked points.\n","\n","Simply put, the model considers every possible splits and takes the one that maximizes the information gain.\n","\n","* 3. Support Vector Machine: Support vector machines classify data by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes in the training data. In a two-dimensional example with two classes, we can think of a hyperplane as the widest straight “band” (i.e., line with margins) that separates the two classes.\n","\n","* 4. Guassian Naive Bayes: The most common type of naive Bayes classifier is the Gaussian naive Bayes. In Gaussian naive Bayes, we assume that the likelihood of the feature values, x, given an\n","observation is of class y, follows a normal distribution.\n","\n","* 5. Random Forest: A common problem with decision trees is that they tend to fit the training data too closely (i.e., overfitting). This has motivated the widespread use of an ensemble learning method called random forest. In a random forest, many decision trees are trained, but each tree only receives a bootstrapped sample of observations (i.e., a random sample of observations with replacement that matches the original number of observations) and each node only considers a subset of features when determining the best split. This forest of randomized decision trees (hence the name) votes to determine the predicted class\n","\n","* 6. Bagging(Decision Tree): A Bagging classifier is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way to reduce the variance of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Give names to the models\n","\n","Instantiate the models with default parameters"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":81,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Give names to the models\n","names = ['LR', 'DTree', 'SVM', 'MNB', 'RF', 'bag_model']\n","\n","# Instantiate the models.\n","classifiers = [\n","    LogisticRegression(),\n","    tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None, criterion='entropy'),\n","    GaussianNB(),\n","    SGDClassifier(),\n","    RandomForestClassifier(),\n","    BaggingClassifier(\n","        base_estimator=tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None, criterion='entropy'),\n","        n_estimators=10,\n","        max_samples=0.6,\n","        oob_score=True,\n","        random_state=42\n","        )\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["No resampled data Modelling"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":72,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Fitting LR model.....\n",".....

It is simply the proportion of observations predicted correctly:\n","\n","    * Accuracy =  TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN\n","where:\n","* TP is the number of true positives. Observations that are part of the positive class (clients that do not commit fraud) and that we predicted correctly.\n","* TN is the number of true negatives. Observations that are part of the negative class (clients that commit fraud) and that we predicted correctly.\n","* FP is the number of false positives. Also called a Type I error. Observations predicted to be part of the positive class that are actually part of the negative class.\n","* FN is the number of false negatives. Also called a Type II error. Observations predicted to be part of the negative class that are actually part of the positive class.\n","\n","The appeal of accuracy is that it has intuitive and plain English explanation: proportion of observations predicted correctly. However, in the real world, often our data has imbalanced classes. When in the presence of imbalanced classes, accuracy suffers from a paradox where a model is highly accurate but lacks predictive power.\n","\n","For this reason, we are often motivated to use other metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.\n","\n","### Precision\n","Precision answers the question of “what proportion of predicted positives in a class are truly postitive in that class?.\n","\n","    * Precision =  TP / TP + FP\n","\n","We can think about it as a measurement noise in our predictions - that is, when we predict something is positive, how likely we are to be right. Models with high precision are *pessimistic* in that they only predict an observation is of the positive class when they are very certain about it.\n","\n","### Recall\n","When the outcome is actually yes, how often do we predict it as such?\n","\n","    * Precision =  TP / TP + FN\n","Recall measures the model’s ability to identify an observation of the positive class. Models with high recall are *optimistic* in that they have a low bar for predicting that an observation is in the positive class.\n","\n","### F1-Score\n","\n","It is calculated by taking the *harmonic mean of precision and recall* and ranges from 0 to 1. It is a more robust measure especially for imbalanced data.\n","Almost always we want some kind of balance between precision and recall, and this role is filled by the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean (a kind of average used for ratios):\n","\n","    * F1-Score = 2 × Precision × Recall Precision + Recall\n","\n","It is a measure of correctness achieved in positive
